# Vault Plugin: Google Cloud Platform Secrets Backend [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp)

This is a backend plugin to be used with [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.github.com/hashicorp/vault).
This plugin generates either one-time (non-renewable) OAuth2 access tokens or
service account keys with a given set of [IAM roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles)
bound to GCP resources for various GCP entities to authenticate with Vault.

**Please note**: We take Vault's security and our users' trust very seriously.
If you believe you have found a security issue in Vault or with this plugin,
_please responsibly disclose_ by
contacting us at [security@hashicorp.com](mailto:security@hashicorp.com).

## Usage

This is a [Vault plugin](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/plugins.html)
and is meant to work with Vault. This guide assumes you have already installed Vault
and have a basic understanding of how Vault works. Otherwise, first read this guide on
how to [get started with Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

If you are just interested in using this plugin with Vault, it is packaged with Vault and
by default can be enabled by running:

```sh
$ vault secrets enable gcp
Success! Enabled the gcp secrets engine at: gcp/
```

If you are testing this plugin in an earlier version of Vault or want to
test or use a custom build of the plugin, see the next section.

## Developing

If you wish to work on this plugin, you'll first need [Go](https://www.golang.org)
installed on your machine (whichever version is required by Vault).

Make sure Go is properly installed, including setting up a [GOPATH](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH).

### Build Plugin

1. Clone this repository:

    ```sh
    $ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp`
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/
    $ git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp.git
    ```

    or use `go get github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp`

1. You can then download any required build tools by bootstrapping your
environment:

    ```sh
    $ make bootstrap
    ```

1. To compile a development version of this plugin, run `make` or `make dev`.
This will put the plugin binary in the `bin` and `$GOPATH/bin` folders. `dev`
mode will only generate the binary for your platform and is faster:

    ```sh
    $ make
    $ make dev
    ```

### Start Vault

You will need a Vault instance running locally with a development plugin directory set up.

1. Start a local Vault server:

    ```sh
    $ vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id=root -dev-plugin-dir="$GOPATH/vault-plugins"
    ```
   
### Set Up Plugin in Vault

Next you want Vault to use the newly built binary instead of the version bundled with Vault.
You can use the scripted or manual methods depending on your preference.

Scripted method.

1. A Terraform project sets up the necessary gcp service account & credentials.
   You can configure the project id via this environment variable: `TF_VAR_GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` 
   or paste it in the terminal when prompted.

    ```sh
    $ make setup-env   
    ```

2. Source the environment variables generated by the setup project:

    ```sh
    $ source ./bootstrap/terraform/local_environment_setup.sh
    ```

3. Enable the dev version of the plugin on your local Vault instance. You can specify the plugin name,
   development plugin directory and mount path or leave empty to use the default values.

    ```sh
    $ make configure PLUGIN_NAME=vault-plugin-secrets-gcp PLUGIN_DIR=$GOPATH/vault-plugins PLUGIN_PATH=local-gcp
    ```

Manual method.

1. Save the name of your test project as an environment variable for reference:

    ```sh
    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=my-project # replace with your project ID
    ```

   Do not use a production project. Use a dedicated project for testing.

1. Enable the IAM service on the project:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud services enable --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}" \
        cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
        iam.googleapis.com
    ```

1. Create a testing service account:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud iam service-accounts create vault-tester \
        --display-name vault-tester \
        --project "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}"
    ```

1. Grant required test permissions:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/owner"

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator"

    $ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding "${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}" \
        --member "serviceAccount:vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
        --role "roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin"
    ```

   Note: these are overly broad permissions because the account needs a
   superset of all permissions it might grant. For this reason, it is
   **strongly recommended** that you have a dedicated project for running
   tests.

1. Download the service account key file to local disk:

    ```sh
    $ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create vault-tester.json \
        --iam-account "vault-tester@${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    ```

1. Export the credentials to an environment variable. You can set the env variable to either
   the path or the JSON itself, i.e.

    ```sh
    $ export GOOGLE_TEST_CREDENTIALS="path/to/vault-tester.json"
    ```

1. Register the local plugin version

    ```sh
    $ vault plugin register \
      -sha256="$(shasum -a 256 "/path/to/plugin/dir/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp" | awk '{print $1}')" \
      secret "vault-plugin-secrets-gcp"
    ```

1. Enable the GCP secrets engine

    ```sh
    vault secrets enable --plugin-name="vault-plugin-secrets-gcp" --path="local-gcp" plugin
    ```

1. Write the configuration to allow connection to your google cloud project

    ```sh
    vault write local-gcp/config credentials=@"$GOOGLE_TEST_CREDENTIALS"
    ```

## Tests

### Unit Tests
To run the unit tests:

1. Run the unit tests:

   ```sh
   $ make test
   ```

### Acceptance Tests
This plugin also has comprehensive [acceptance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing)
covering most of the features of this secrets backend.

**Warning:** The acceptance tests create/destroy/modify *real resources*,
which may incur real costs in some cases. In the presence of a bug,
it is technically possible that broken backends could leave dangling
data behind. Therefore, please run the acceptance tests at your own risk.
At the very least, we recommend running them in their own private
account for whatever backend you're testing.

To run the acceptance tests, you will need a GCP IAM service account with the
appropriate permissions. You can use the steps explained in the [setup section](#set-up-plugin-in-vault) to configure one for you.

1. Save the name of your test project as an environment variable for reference:

    ```text
    $ export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=my-project # replace with your project ID
    ```

1. Run the acceptance tests:

    ```text
    $ make testacc
    ```

## Auto-generated IAM Config

An IAM-enabled resource (under an arbitrary GCP service) supports the following three IAM methods:

* `getIamPolicy`
* `setIamPolicy`
* `testIamPermissions`

In the case of this secrets engine, we need to call `getIamPolicy` and `setIamPolicy` on
an arbitrary resource under an arbitrary service, which would be difficult using
the [generated Go google APIs](https://github.com/google/google-api-go-client). Instead,
we autogenerated a library, using the [Google API Discovery Service](https://developers.google.com/discovery/)
to find IAM-enabled resources and configure HTTP calls on arbitrary services/resources for IAM.

For each binding config resource block (with a resource name), we attempt to find the resource type based on the
relative resource name and match it to a service config as seen in this
[autogenerated config file](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp/blob/master/plugin/iamutil/iam_resources_generated.go)

To re-generate this file, run:

```
go generate github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp/plugin/iamutil
```


In general, we try to make it so you can specify the resource as given in the HTTP API URL
(between base API URL and get/setIamPolicy suffix). For some possibly non-standard APIs, we have also
 added exceptions to try to reach something more standard; a notable current example is the Google Cloud Storage API,
 whose methods look like `https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/bucket/o/object` where we accept either
 `b/bucket/o/object` or `buckets/bucket/objects/object` as valid relative resource names.

If you are having trouble during role set creation with errors suggesting the resource format is invalid or API calls
are failing for a resource you know exists, please [report any issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-secrets-gcp/issues)
you run into. It could be that the API is a non-standard form or we need to re-generate our config file.
